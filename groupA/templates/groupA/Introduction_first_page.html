      <p>For the purpose of this study, we are going to ask you to choose between two portfolios.<p> 
      
      <p>Each portfolio is composed of 20 different stocks. The riskiness level of both portfolios is the same, therefore you do not need to take that into account.
	  In each step you need to select between a "Portfolio 1" and a "Portfolio 2".<p> 

	  <p> You will have some information regarding both portfolio choices - you will know the return you would earn each year by choosing it as well as the environmental score of
	  each of the portfolios. The environmental score of a portfolio is the average score of 20 environmental scores of each stock that is included in the portfolio. <p>
