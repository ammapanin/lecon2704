       <p>For the purpose of this study, we are going to ask you to choose between two portfolios.<p> 
      
      <p>Each portfolio is composed of 20 different stocks. The riskiness level of both portfolios is the same, therefore you do not need to take that into account.
	  In each step you need to select between a "Portfolio 1" and a "Portfolio 2".<p> 

	  <p> You will have some information regarding both portfolio
	choices - you will know the return you would earn each year by
	choosing it as well as the environmental score of each of the
	portfolios. The environmental score is assigned to each stock
	within both portfolios and measures how sustainable a given
	enterprise is. This score is the weighted average rating of a
	company based on the reported environmental information
	regarding their ressource use, emissions and innovation. The environmental score of a portfolio is the average score of 20 environmental scores of each stock that is included in the portfolio.
	The higher the environmental score is, the more sustainable the portfolio is. <p>
